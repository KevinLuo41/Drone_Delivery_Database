# Project 4400 Drone Grocery Delivery

## Set up
All python packages are built-in except for FLASK.
```
pip install flask
```

## Run
Direct to project folder.

``` 
cd XXX/Database_Project 
```

``` 
python server.py
```
Go to  http://127.0.0.1:5000/ flask default server url.

Everything all set!

## Techonologies

For the backend, we used flask as framework. Flask has built-in package called "flaskext" to help connect with MySQL server. 

For the frontend, we use plain html + js to achieve basic function. No UI design due to limited time.
